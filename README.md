# XiangQiEngineInCpp
It's basically just a Xiangqi engine that uses minimax. It's not very efficient though (iterative deepening is implemented but not that efficient)

It is text-based. Enter the moves in the form of start_row, start_col, end_row, end_col.

The row numbers are located at the top of the displayed board while the column numbers are located at the side.

For example, if you wanted to move the cannon at row 7, column 7 to row 7, column 4, you would enter the 4 numbers (7, 7, 7, 4). Just enter the numbers without the brackets, separated by spaces.
